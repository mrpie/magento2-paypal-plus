PayPal PLUS is a solution where PayPal offers PayPal, Credit Card and ELV (pay upon invoice will be added in a later phase) as individual payment options on the payment selection page.
Based on the payment method selected by the buyer, he will at a later stage be presented with either the PayPal Login page or an input mask for bank / credit card details.
